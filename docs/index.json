We’ll use a StockQuote record for that: @Builder public record StockQuote(String id, String symbol, String exchange, String currency, String tradeValue) { } The Kafka publisher itself will look something like this: @Component @Slf4j public class StockQuotePublisher { private final KafkaTemplate\u003cString, StockQuote\u003e stockQuotePublisher; public StockQuotePublisher(KafkaTemplate\u003cString, StockQuote\u003e stockQuotePublisher) { this.stockQuotePublisher = stockQuotePublisher; } public void publish(StockQuote stockQuote) { log.info(\"Publishing stock quote: {}\", stockQuote); stockQuotePublisher.send(KafkaTopics.STOCK_QUOTES_TOPIC, stockQuote.id(), stockQuote); } } Since we want to look at metrics, let also write a generator class which will publish messages quite frequently to kafka, so that we’ll have more data to look at. @Component public class StockQuoteGenerator { private static final String[] EXCHANGES = {\"NYSE\", \"NSDQ\"}; private static final String[] STOCK_SYMBOLS = {\"DAVA\", \"AAPL\", \"NFLX\", \"META\", \"GOGL\", \"TSLA\", \"AMZN\"}; public StockQuote generate() { ThreadLocalRandom random = ThreadLocalRandom.current(); return StockQuote.builder() .id(UUID.randomUUID().toString()) .currency(\"EUR\") .exchange(EXCHANGES[random.nextInt(EXCHANGES.length)]) .symbol(STOCK_SYMBOLS[random.nextInt(STOCK_SYMBOLS.length)]) .tradeValue(BigDecimal.valueOf(random.nextInt(60, 1000)).toString()) .build(); } } Here’s out scheduler: @Component public class StockQuoteScheduler { private final StockQuotePublisher quotePublisher; private final StockQuoteGenerator stockQuoteGenerator; public StockQuoteScheduler(StockQuotePublisher quotePublisher, StockQuoteGenerator stockQuoteGenerator) { this.quotePublisher = quotePublisher; this.stockQuoteGenerator = stockQuoteGenerator; } @Scheduled(fixedRate = 500) public void tick() { StockQuote stockQuote = stockQuoteGenerator.generate(); quotePublisher.publish(stockQuote); } } If we’ll run our application, it should start publishing messages to kafka.

Basically it provides exactly the same information as http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics, the difference being that it’s in an Prometheus-specific format. We can now configure a Prometheus instance to poll this endpoint periodically. The idea is that Prometheus is a time-series database tailored specifically for metrics. Whenever Prometheus will hit the http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus, it will store all the metrics information and associate every metric with a timestamp. By doing that, we can observe how a specific metric evolves over time. Let’s add Prometheus to our docker-compose.yaml file, like shown below: version:'3'services:#Previously defined containers like zookeeper, kafka \u0026 redpanda#...#Prometheusprometheus:image:prom/prometheus:v2.28.1container_name:prometheusports:- \"9090:9090\"volumes:- ./prometheus/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml The prometheus.yml file from above is a simple configuration file which looks like this: global:scrape_interval:30sscrape_configs:- job_name:'spring_micrometer'metrics_path:'/actuator/prometheus'scrape_interval:35sscrape_timeout:30sstatic_configs:- targets:['stock-quote-producer:8080']basic_auth:username:'admin'password:'admin' What’s worth pointing out is that Prometheus will invoke the http://stock-quote-producer:8080/actuator/prometheus endpoint periodically (every 35 seconds). The request timeout for a single call is 30 seconds. Now the catch is that since we’ve run Prometheus as a docker container (which is isolated from our local machine), our application should be run also as a docker container, so that Prometheus can call it. At the moment the above prometheus.yml expects our app to be running on http://stock-quote-producer:8080. So we need now to create a docker image out of our spring boot app and use stock-quote-producer as the container name. Let’s do this.

We’ve just copied the target/kafka-producer-consumer-metrics-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar file into a directory called evil and we’ve also created a new group called evil, with a user named evil as well. Now we’ll modify our docker-compose.yaml file once more so that it includes our spring boot application, like this: version:'3'services:#Previously defined containers like zookeeper, kafka \u0026 redpanda#...stock-quote-producer:build:dockerfile:./infra/docker/Dockerfilecontext:\"../../\"container_name:stock-quote-producerports:- \"8080:8080\"environment:SPRING_KAFKA_PRODUCER_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS:broker:29092restart:on-failuredepends_on:- broker- prometheus Now if we’ll run the new docker-compose.yaml file, all of our metrics data should be stored in prometheus, and we should be able to check how specific metrics evolve over time. To access the Prometheus dashboard, we just need to access the following endpoint: http://localhost:9090/. Now Prometheus is a great tool to store metrics, but it doesn’t have fancy graph-plotting abilities. To fix that we can use Grafana ","date":"2023-04-09","objectID":"/posts/exposing_kafka_producer_and_consumer_metrics_to_actuator/:4:0","tags":["Spring Boot","Apache kafka","metrics","prometheus","grafana"],"title":"Exposing Kafka producer \u0026 consumer metrics to actuator","uri":"/posts/exposing_kafka_producer_and_consumer_metrics_to_actuator/"},{"categories":["Spring Boot","Apache kafka"],"content":"Configuring Grafana In order to use Grafana, we’ll need to add yet another docker container to our docker-compose.yaml file, like shown below: version:'3'services:#Previously defined containers like zookeeper, kafka \u0026 redpanda#...#Grafana dashboardgrafana:image:grafana/grafana:8.0.6container_name:grafanaports:- \"3000:3000\"depends_on:- prometheus The Grafana will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/.

Now let’s try to create a basic Grafana dashboard displaying the kafka_producer_record_send_rate metric, like shown below: In order to see the maximum throughput of our spring boot app, let’s modify out StockQuoteScheduler like shown below, so that it doesn’t publish only 2 messages per second, but much more. @Component public class StockQuoteScheduler { //... @PostConstruct private void init() { new Thread(() -\u003e { try { while (true) { quotePublisher.publish(stockQuoteGenerator.generate()); } } catch (Exception e) { log.error(\"Kafka producer error\", e); } }).start(); } } Now, if we’ll try to run our app in this configuration, we’ll see that our application produces about 80K messages per second.

It is a simple REST API for a simple anonymous forum, having categories, topics and comments. Let’s have a look more closely at the categories part of the application. The Category entity will look something like this: @Data public class DynamoDbBase { protected String partitionKey; protected String sortKey; @DynamoDbPartitionKey @DynamoDbAttribute(\"PK\") public String getPartitionKey() { return partitionKey; } @DynamoDbSortKey @DynamoDbAttribute(\"SK\") public String getSortKey() { return sortKey; } } The DynamoDbBase will act as the base-class for all entities. It has a generic partition and sort key, because we plan to use a single DynamoDB table for all entities (also known as Single table design). Now the Category entity finally looks like the following: @DynamoDbBean @EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = true) public class Category extends DynamoDbBase { public static final String CATEGORY_PK = \"Category\"; public static final String CATEGORY_SK_PREFIX = \"Category#\"; private String name; public Category() { } public Category(CategoryBuilder builder) { this.name = builder.name; this.partitionKey = builder.partitionKey; this.sortKey = builder.sortKey; } public void setId(String id) { setPartitionKey(CATEGORY_PK); setSortKey(CategoryKeyBuilder.makeSortKey(id)); } public String getId() { return getSortKey().substring(CATEGORY_SK_PREFIX.length()); } public String getName() { return this.name; } public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; } public static CategoryBuilder builder() { return new CategoryBuilder(); } public static class CategoryKeyBuilder { public static String makePartitionKey(String id) { return CATEGORY_PK; } public static String makeSortKey(String id) { return CATEGORY_SK_PREFIX + id; } } public static class CategoryBuilder { private String name; private String partitionKey; private String sortKey; public CategoryBuilder name(String name) { this.name = name; return this; } public CategoryBuilder partitionKey(String partitionKey) { this.partitionKey = partitionKey; return this; } public CategoryBuilder sortKey(String sortKey) { this.sortKey = sortKey; return this; } public Category build() { return new Category(this); } } } It is quite simple, it just has a name attribute, getters \u0026 setters and a builder. Also we’ll need to add a bit of configuration, by providing the DynamoDbEnhancedClient and DynamoDbTable beans, like shown below: @Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false) @EnableConfigurationProperties(AwsProperties.class) public class DynamoDbConfig { @Bean public DynamoDbClient dynamoDbClient(AwsProperties properties, AwsBasicCredentials awsCredentials) { var builder = DynamoDbClient.builder() .region(Region.of(properties.region())); if (properties.endpointOverride() != null) { builder.endpointOverride(URI.create(properties.endpointOverride())); } return builder.credentialsProvider(() -\u003e awsCredentials).build(); } @Bean public AwsBasicCredentials awsCredentials(AwsProperties properties) { return AwsBasicCredentials.create(properties.credentials().accessKey(), properties.credentials().secretKey()); } @Bean public DynamoDbEnhancedClient dynamoDbEnhancedClient(DynamoDbClient dynamoDbClient) { return DynamoDbEnhancedClient.builder() .dynamoDbClient(dynamoDbClient) .build(); } @Bean public DynamoDbTable\u003cCategory\u003e categoryTable(DynamoDbEnhancedClient dynamoDbEnhancedClient, AwsProperties properties) { return dynamoDbEnhancedClient.table(properties.dynamoDbTableName(), TableSchema.fromBean(Category.class)); } } Let’s try to write a repository for the Category entity: public interface CategoryRepository { List\u003cCategory\u003e findAll(); Category create(Category categoryToCreate); Optional\u003cCategory\u003e findById(String id); } The CategoryRepository interface specifies the repository contract, at the moment having the findAll(), findById() and create() operations.

What’s worth noting is that before each test we try to clean up the table, by deleting the table and re-creating it. We also insert some test data so that we have something to work with. Also it’s worth pointing out that this test uses Localstack to simulate the real DynamoDB service. We spin-up Localstack using Testcontainers, and the AbstractDatabaseTest contains all the guts related to that: public class AbstractDatabaseTest { private static final String TABLE_NAME = \"forum\"; public static final LocalStackContainer localstack = new LocalStackContainer(DockerImageName.parse(\"localstack/localstack:1.4\")) .withServices(LocalStackContainer.Service.DYNAMODB); @DynamicPropertySource public static void replaceProperties(DynamicPropertyRegistry registry) { registry.add(\"aws.endpoint-override\", () -\u003e localstack.getEndpointOverride(LocalStackContainer.Service.DYNAMODB)); registry.add(\"aws.credentials.secret-key\", localstack::getSecretKey); registry.add(\"aws.credentials.access-key\", localstack::getAccessKey); registry.add(\"aws.region\", localstack::getRegion); } static { localstack.start(); createResources(); } private static void createResources() { try { localstack.execInContainer(\"awslocal\", \"dynamodb\", \"create-table\", \"--table-name\", TABLE_NAME, \"--attribute-definitions\", \"AttributeName=PK,AttributeType=S\", \"AttributeName=SK,AttributeType=S\", \"--key-schema\", \"AttributeName=PK,KeyType=HASH\", \"AttributeName=SK,KeyType=RANGE\", \"--provisioned-throughput\", \"ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5\"); } catch (IOException | InterruptedException e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); } } } A slight problem with this test is that it uses the @SpringBootTest which pretty much spins up the whole application context, containing not only repository-specific classes, but also web related ones for example. This can increase the test’s startup time and it’s a shame, since we don’t care about the web layer for this particular test. Let’s try to fix this, by writing a custom test slice.

We want something like @DataJpaTest, which allows us to either spin up only the repository layer. Let’s take a look at the @DataJpaTest annotation, so that we find some inspiration: @Target({ElementType.TYPE}) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Documented @Inherited @BootstrapWith(DataJdbcTestContextBootstrapper.class) @ExtendWith({SpringExtension.class}) @OverrideAutoConfiguration( enabled = false ) @TypeExcludeFilters({DataJdbcTypeExcludeFilter.class}) @Transactional @AutoConfigureCache @AutoConfigureDataJdbc @AutoConfigureTestDatabase @ImportAutoConfiguration public @interface DataJdbcTest { //... } The most interesting parts are the following: @OverrideAutoConfiguration(enabled = false): disables auto-configuration @BootstrapWith(DataJdbcTestContextBootstrapper.class): specifies how to bootstrap the application context. DataJdbcTestContextBootstrapper is a small specialization of SpringBootTestContextBootstrapper @ImportAutoConfiguration: allows to import some auto-configurations. It’s useful since all auto-configurations were disabled by @OverrideAutoConfiguration(enabled = false) @TypeExcludeFilters({DataJdbcTypeExcludeFilter.class}): this is the most interesting one, this is the actual filter of the beans which we want to include/exclude from the application context Everything else just configures the repository infrastructure, like enabling caching (via @AutoConfigureCache) and transactions (via @Transactional). Now let’s try to create a similar thing for DynamoDB. We’ll create a custom annotation named @DynamoDbTest, which initially will look like the following: @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) @OverrideAutoConfiguration(enabled = false) @BootstrapWith(SpringBootTestContextBootstrapper.class) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.TYPE) public @interface DynamoDbTest { Class\u003c?\u003e[] repositories() default {}; } Since we didn’t add yet the @TypeExcludeFilters annotation, with a custom implementation of the TypeExcludeFilter, we’ll still end up with the whole application context. But let’s try to annotate our DynamoDBCategoryRepositoryTest with the @DynamoDbTest annotation, just to make sure everything still works: @DynamoDbTest public class DynamoDBCategoryRepositoryTest extends AbstractDatabaseTest { @Autowired private DynamoDbTable\u003cCategory\u003e categoryTable; @Autowired private DynamoDBCategoryRepository categoryRepository; @BeforeEach public void setUp() { categoryTable.deleteTable(); categoryTable.createTable(); categoryTable.putItem(Category.builder() .name(\"Software development\") .partitionKey(\"Category\") .sortKey(\"Category#501735c3-5da7-4684-82d3-37af5d5dc44f\") .build()); categoryTable.putItem(Category.builder() .name(\"Anime\") .partitionKey(\"Category\") .sortKey(\"Category#601735c3-6da7-4684-62d3-47af5d5dc44e\") .build()); } @Test public void shouldBeAbleToFindAllCategories() { List\u003cCategory\u003e expectedCategories = List.of( Category.builder() .name(\"Software development\") .partitionKey(\"Category\") .sortKey(\"Category#501735c3-5da7-4684-82d3-37af5d5dc44f\") .build(), Category.builder() .name(\"Anime\") .partitionKey(\"Category\") .sortKey(\"Category#601735c3-6da7-4684-62d3-47af5d5dc44e\") .build() ); List\u003cCategory\u003e actualCategories = categoryRepository.findAll(); assertThat(actualCategories).isEqualTo(expectedCategories); } } If we try to run the tests, they pass, which means that we didn’t broke anything yet. If we try to inject the ApplicationContext into our DynamoDBCategoryRepositoryTest and inspect it in the debugger, we’ll see something like this: We can observe that our ApplicationContext contains all the beans, including the ones from the web-layer which we’re not interested in for this particular test. In order to fix that, we’ll implement a custom TypeExcludeFilter. It will look something like this: public class DynamoDbTypeExcludeFilter extends AnnotationCustomizableTypeExcludeFilter { private static final Set\u003cClass\u003c?\u003e\u003e DEFAULT","date":"2023-03-26","objectID":"/posts/creating_a_custom_spring_boot_test_slice/:2:0","tags":["Spring Boot","Testing","Localstack","DynamoDB"],"title":"Creating a custom Spring Boot test slice","uri":"/posts/creating_a_custom_spring_boot_test_slice/"},{"categories":["Spring Boot","DynamoDB"],"content":"Conclusion In this blog post we saw how to create a custom Spring Boot test slice for DynamoDB.

We’ll use a simple HTTP api, exposing CRUD operations for movies. Let’s say we have the following controller: @RestController @RequestMapping(\"/api/v1/movies\") public class MovieController { private final MovieService movieService; public MovieController(MovieService movieService) { this.movieService = movieService; } @GetMapping public List\u003cMovieResponse\u003e getAll() { return movieService.getAll(); } @GetMapping(\"{id}\") public MovieResponse getById(@PathVariable(\"id\") Long id) { return movieService.getById(id); } @PostMapping public ResponseEntity\u003cMovieResponse\u003e create(@RequestBody @Validated CreateMovieRequest request) { MovieResponse createdMovie = movieService.create(request.toMovie()); URI location = MvcUriComponentsBuilder.fromMethodCall(MvcUriComponentsBuilder.on(getClass()) .getById(createdMovie.id())) .build() .toUri(); return ResponseEntity.created(location) .body(createdMovie); } } As we can see, the controller does not have any sophisticated logic (and it should be like this stop putting business logic in controllers), it just delegates to the service. To make things clearer, let’s take a look at the service as well. @Service public class MovieService { private final MovieRepository movieRepository; public MovieService(MovieRepository movieRepository) { this.movieRepository = movieRepository; } @Transactional(readOnly = true) public List\u003cMovieResponse\u003e getAll() { return movieRepository.findAll() .stream() .map(MovieResponse::from) .toList(); } @Transactional(readOnly = true) public MovieResponse getById(Long id) { Movie movie = movieRepository.findById(id) .orElseThrow(() -\u003e new EntityNotFoundException(\"No movie with id:' \" + id + \"' was found.\")); return MovieResponse.from(movie); } @Transactional public MovieResponse create(Movie movieToCreate) { Movie createdMovie = movieRepository.save(movieToCreate); return MovieResponse.from(createdMovie); } } The service is also not that complicated, it has some basic operations like create and get movie by id and it just uses a simple Spring-Data-JPA repository. Using this simple REST api, let’s try to simulate some errors to see how the default error responses will look like. The simplest endpoint to call can be finding a movie by id. Let’s see the successful scenario: GET http://localhost:8081/api/v1/movies/1 And we get the following response: HTTP/1.1 200 Content-Type: application/json Transfer-Encoding: chunked Date: Mon, 27 Jun 2022 20:00:48 GMT Keep-Alive: timeout=60 Connection: keep-alive { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Pulp Fiction\", \"publishYear\": 1994 } Now let’s try to simulate an error. If we look at our endpoint, we can see that the movie id has the type java.lang.Long. What will happen if the user will pass something that cannot be parsed as a Long? @RestController @RequestMapping(\"/api/v1/movies\") public class MovieController { //... @GetMapping(\"{id}\") public MovieResponse getById(@PathVariable(\"id\") Long id) { return movieService.getById(id); } //... } Let’s find out. We’ll use the string 'a' as an invalid id. GET http://localhost:8081/api/v1/movies/a And we get back the following response: HTTP/1.1 400 Content-Type: application/json Transfer-Encoding: chunked Date: Mon, 27 Jun 2022 20:08:57 GMT Connection: close { \"timestamp\": \"2022-06-27T20:08:57.459+00:00\", \"status\": 400, \"error\": \"Bad Request\", \"path\": \"/api/v1/movies/a\" } We got back an HTTP response with the status code 400 Bad request with a json payload describing the error, all of that was done by Spring Boot, without any configuration. Pretty good for a default, but the problem with that response is that it communicates almost nothing. Something’s wrong with our request, but what exactly?

It is needed because we want our GlobalExceptionHandler to be the last one called, when a controller didn’t handle an exception. Sometimes there are exceptions specific for a particular controller. In that case we want to allow the possibility of having controller-specific controller-advices. Or in other words, we want the GlobalExceptionHandler to be the last controller-advice which is called, and allow controller-specific controller-advices to be executed first. Now, in order to return a pretty error response, we need a DTO class containing information about the error. We’ll call it ErrorResponse, and it will look something like this: public record ErrorResponse(String statusCode, String path, List\u003cString\u003e messages) { @Builder public ErrorResponse { } } It has just 3 fields: statusCode: represents the error status code.

Value 'a' could not be bound to type: 'long'\" ] } Now it’s way more clear what’s wrong. The value a is not a numeric value. There are some downsides though. One could argue that our error message is too revealing, and that communicating to the user that we expect a long value can give a hint to a malicious user in what language our REST api was written in. We can argue that this is not a huge problem, we can easily change the error message to not include the expected type. Everything is up to us.

Also an important part is that we have to include the @Order(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE) annotation as well, to force the MovieControllerAdvice to be executed before the GlobalExceptionHandler (because the GlobalExceptionHandler can have a generic, “catch-all” @ExceptionHandler).

When also reactive types like Mono and Flux, which are supported as well. Using the @GetExchange(\"/jokes/random\") annotation, we specify that we want an HTTP GET request executed to the /jokes/random endpoint. There are also other annotations, for the rest of HTTP methods like: @PostExchange: for HTTP POST method. The HTTP interface method parameter representing the request payload should be annotated with the @RequestBody annotation @PutExchange: for HTTP PUT method @PatchExchange: for HTTP PATCH method @DelectExchange: for HTTP DELETE method @HttpExchange: the most generic one. All annotations above are meta-annotated with the @HttpExchange annotation. For example @GetExchange(\"/jokes/random\") is equivalent to @HttpExchange(url = \"/jokes/random\", method = \"GET\") We can also use the @HttpExchange annotation to specify attributes common to all HTTP interface methods (like contentType, accept, or url prefix), like shown below: @HttpExchange(url = \"/jokes\") interface ChuckNorrisClient { @HttpExchange(url = \"/random\", method = \"GET\") ChuckNorrisQuote getRandomQuote(); @GetExchange(\"/random\") ChuckNorrisQuote getQuoteFromCategory(@RequestParam(\"category\") String category); @GetExchange(\"/categories\") List\u003cString\u003e getCategories(); } Moving on.

Concurrency control is about managing concurrent access to our data. Let’s say for example that we have a hotel booking system and there’s only one room available in the hotel and 2 users at the same time try to book it. Who will get the room? Well, it’s possible that both of them will succeed, but that will leave the hotel staff with an awkward situation. Concurrency control patterns help to deal with issues like this, either by preventing or detecting them. There are 2 flavours of concurrency control - pessimistic and optimistic locking. Pessimistic locking - prevents conflicts. We’re pessimistic and sure that conflicts will happen, therefore we block concurrent modifications by locking the data for exclusive access. Optimistic locking - detects conflicts. We’re optimistic that conflicts (or concurrent modifications) won’t happen, but if they do happen, we detect and deal with them, usually by issuing retries or returning an error response. Let’s take a closer look at both of these approaches in practice.

Here’s the domain model: @Entity @Table(name = \"doctors\") public class Doctor extends AbstractEntity { private String firstName; private String lastName; @Column(name = \"email_address\", nullable = false) private String email; @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING) private Specialty specialty; private String telephoneNumber; protected Doctor() { } //Getters, setters, builder, equals \u0026 hashcode were omitted for brevity } We have the Doctor JPA entity, having some simple fields identifying a particular doctor. Next, we’ll need a patient, which can look like this: @Entity @Table(name = \"patients\") public class Patient extends AbstractEntity { private String firstName; private String lastName; private String phoneNumber; private String source; private LocalDate birthDate; protected Patient() { } //Getters, setters, builder, equals \u0026 hashcode were omitted for brevity } Nothing fancy yet, another simple JPA entity representing a patient. Finally, let’s have a look at the Appointment entity, representing an appointment of a patient to a doctor which occurs at a specific date and time. @Entity @Table(name = \"appointments\") public class Appointment extends AbstractEntity { @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = false) private Doctor doctor; @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = false) private Patient patient; private LocalDate appointmentDate; private LocalTime startTime; private LocalTime endTime; private String operation; private String details; protected Appointment() { } //Getters, setters, builder, equals \u0026 hashcode were omitted for brevity } Now, let’s implement the REST endpoint for the appointment creation, it can look something like this: @RestController @RequestMapping(\"/api/v1/appointments\") public class AppointmentController { private final AppointmentFacade appointmentFacade; public AppointmentController(AppointmentFacade appointmentFacade) { this.appointmentFacade = appointmentFacade; } @PostMapping public ResponseEntity\u003c?\u003e create(@RequestBody @Validated(ValidationSequence.class) UpsertAppointmentRequest request) { AppointmentResponse createdAppointment = appointmentFacade.create(request); URI location = MvcUriComponentsBuilder.fromMethodCall(MvcUriComponentsBuilder.on(getClass()) .findById(createdAppointment.getId())) .build() .toUri(); return ResponseEntity.created(location) .build(); } } We have just a simple HTTP POST endpoint for creating a new appointment. The controller just delegates the request to the AppointmentFacade, which we’ll see briefly, and then it returns a response containing the Location header pointing to the newly created appointment. The request payload will look like this: POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/appointments Content-Type: application/json { \"startDate\": \"2021-12-13T17:00\", \"endDate\": \"2021-12-13T18:00\", \"operation\": \"Annual physical\", \"doctorId\": \"f23e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\", \"patientId\": \"f44e4567-ef9c-12d3-a45b-52661417400a\", \"details\": \"Just a regular annual physical\" } Moving on, let’s have a look at the AppointmentFacade. The purpose of it is to just convert the web-specific DTO - the UpsertAppointmentRequest into the domain model the service layer understands - the Appointment JPA entity. Also before returning the response, it converts the Appointment entity (which the service layer returned) to another web-specific DTO - the AppointmentResponse in this case. @Component public class AppointmentFacade { private final AppointmentService appointmentService; private final DoctorService doctorService; private final PatientService patientService; public AppointmentFacade(AppointmentService appointmentService, DoctorService doctorService, PatientService patientService) { this.appointmentService = appointmentService; this.doctorService = doctorService; this.patientService = patientService; } public Appointmen","date":"2022-05-19","objectID":"/posts/optimistic_and_pessimistic_locking_with_spring_data_jpa/:2:0","tags":["Spring Framework","Concurrency control","Pessimistic locking","Optimistic locking"],"title":"Optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control with Spring-Data-JPA","uri":"/posts/optimistic_and_pessimistic_locking_with_spring_data_jpa/"},{"categories":["Concurrency control","Spring Framework"],"content":"Testing the solution Let’s try to write an integration test, which spins-up the whole application, executes a real HTTP request which will go through all the layers of the application (though the controller, facade, service, repository and back) and see if it works: @SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT) public class AppointmentControllerTest extends AbstractWebIntegrationTest { @Test public void shouldBeAbleToCreateAppointments() { String payload = \"\"\" { \"doctorId\": \"620e11c0-7d59-45be-85cc-0dc146532e78\", \"patientId\": \"f44e4567-ef9c-12d3-a45b-52661417400a\", \"startDate\": \"2022-05-23T16:00\", \"endDate\": \"2022-05-23T17:00\", \"operation\": \"Annual physical\", \"details\": \"New patient\" } \"\"\"; RequestEntity\u003cString\u003e request = makeRequestFor(\"/api/v1/appointments/\", HttpMethod.POST, payload); ResponseEntity\u003cString\u003e response = restTemplate.exchange(request, String.class); assertThat(response.getStatusCode().value()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.CREATED.value()); assertThat(response.getHeaders().getLocation()).isNotNull(); } } If we try to run the test, it’ll pass with flying colors. But is it really working? Well, not really. We haven’t implemented any form of concurrency control in our application. We have the AppointmentRepository.findConflictingAppointment() method, but is it really working? Spoiler alert - it doesn’t. We have a race condition, the check-then-act sequence. When we want to insert a new appointment, we first check if we won’t create overlapping appointments (by calling the AppointmentRepository.findConflictingAppointment()), then if we didn’t spot an overlap, we insert the new appointment. That means that there’s a possibility that 2 different users at the same time will try to create an appointment to the same doctor, on the same day and time rage and both of them will succeed. Both of them checked for overlapping appointments at the same time. They didn’t find anything and proceeded with the insert. Now we have 2 appointments with the same time range which succeeded. The doctor wil definitely be confused.

We can use this technique to try to fix our broken AppointmentService.create() method. When using pessimistic locking with Hibernate, a SQL Select for update is used under the hood. Select for update works by placing an exclusive lock on all of the rows returned, so that any other transaction will be blocked from accessing those rows (both for read and update). We can use this trick to obtain mutual exclusion for our AppointmentService.create() method. But what exactly should we lock? Since what we want to prevent is having 2 appointments for the same doctor at the same time, we can execute a Select for update on the doctor, something like this: selectid,first_name...fromdoctorsdwhered.id=\u003c\u003cdoctorIdforwhichweareaddinganappointment\u003e\u003eforupdate effectively gaining exclusive access to the doctor. From the moment the lock was obtained till the transaction will be committed, no other transaction will be able to read (or modify) the doctor. We can add a new method to our DoctorRepository for that: @Repository public interface DoctorRepository extends JpaRepository\u003cDoctor, String\u003e { @Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE) @Query(\"select d from Doctor d where d.id = :id\") Doctor findByIdAndLock(@Param(\"id\") String id); } Notice the @Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE) annotation - it’s the Spring-Data's way of telling that we want to use pessimistic locking for the method. Note There’s also @Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_READ) which is translated to Select for share. With this type of lock multiple transactions can read the database table row at the same time, but “writer” transactions (executing updates) will be blocked. And vice versa, when an update is in progress, no “reader” transactions can obtain the shared lock. Now, we can try to use this method to obtain mutual-exclusion in our AppointmentService.create() method: @Service @Slf4j public class AppointmentService { private final AppointmentRepository appointmentRepository; private final DoctorRepository doctorRepository; public AppointmentService(AppointmentRepository appointmentRepository, DoctorRepository doctorRepository) { this.appointmentRepository = appointmentRepository; this.doctorRepository = doctorRepository; } @Transactional public Appointment create(Appointment appointmentToCreate) { checkForConflicts(appointmentToCreate); return appointmentRepository.save(appointmentToCreate); } private void checkForConflicts(Appointment appointmentToCreate) { LocalDate appointmentDate = appointmentToCreate.getAppointmentDate(); LocalTime startTime = appointmentToCreate.getStartTime(); LocalTime endTime = appointmentToCreate.getEndTime(); String doctorId = appointmentToCreate.getDoctor().getId(); Doctor doctor = doctorRepository.findByIdAndLock(doctorId); //here we obtain an exclusive lock for the doctor. From this point onward, //only the current transaction can continue and others will be blocked here //since they can't lock the doctor row Optional\u003cAppointment\u003e conflictingAppointment = appointmentRepository.findConflictingAppointment(doctorId, appointmentDate, startTime, endTime); conflictingAppointment.ifPresent(overlappingAppointment -\u003e { throw new ConflictingAppointmentsException(\"Doctor \" + doctor.getFirstName() + \" \" + doctor.getLastName() + \" has already an appointment, starting from \" + overlappingAppointment.getStartTime() + \" till \" + overlappingAppointment.getEndTime()); }); } } By adding the call to DoctorRepository.findByIdAndLock(doctorId), the first transaction to successfully execute this call will obtain the exclusive lock and therefore, the check-then-act sequence will be executed with mutual-exclusion, eliminating the race condition. Let’s run the test: The test passed, which is very nice. This solution has some drawbacks though.

With this approach, we no longer lock anything and don’t prevent concurrent access, so the throughput (ideally) should not suffer. Instead we let all transactions do their work concurrently, and then at the end decide to commit or rollback them, depending upon whether concurrent modifications we’re spotted or not. In order to use optimistic locking, we’ll need to change our JPA entities and add a new field annotation with the @Version annotation, like shown below: @Entity @Table(name = \"doctors\") public class Doctor extends AbstractEntity { @Column(name = \"first_name\", nullable = false) private String firstName; @Column(name = \"last_name\", nullable = false) private String lastName; @Column(name = \"email_address\", nullable = false) private String email; private String telephoneNumber; @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING) private Specialty specialty; @Version private long version; //In order to use optimistic locking, we add this field } ","date":"2022-05-19","objectID":"/posts/optimistic_and_pessimistic_locking_with_spring_data_jpa/:5:0","tags":["Spring Framework","Concurrency control","Pessimistic locking","Optimistic locking"],"title":"Optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control with Spring-Data-JPA","uri":"/posts/optimistic_and_pessimistic_locking_with_spring_data_jpa/"},{"categories":["Concurrency control","Spring Framework"],"content":"How it works Whenever you have a JPA entity which could be updated by concurrent transactions, most likely you should have optimistic locking in place. Without any locking mechanism, there is potential for silent data loss, a phenomenon known as lost updates. Let’s look at the lost update anomaly more closely. Let’s say that 2 transactions simultaneously try to update the doctor’s name: As we can see, all the work done by Transaction-2 was lost. Imagine that the above flow was something more serious, like booking the last available room in a hotel. We need a way to prevent that. Optimistic locking to the rescue! Now if we implement optimistic locking, the flow will look like this: What’s changed is that now the doctor table has a new column called version. Every time the doctor's database row is changed, Hibernate will increment that version and if during increment it will spot a version mismatch, it will throw a OptimisticLockException. In that case, the Transaction-1 should be re-executed since it was using stale data. The version field will be incremented by Hibernate every time the entity changes its state. Note Hibernate supports the following @Version field types: short or Short int or Integer long or Long java.sql.Timestamp Java 8 Date/Time such as java.time.Instant Using a numeric type which is large-enough (like Long) is the safest approach. Using time-based values, acting as “last modified time” is a bit more risky since theoretically it’s possible to have 2 threads using the same timestamp. Since our Doctor entity now has a @Version field, Hibernate will automatically prevent lost updates whenever the Doctor entity changes its state. But we have a completely different problem. We want to prevent appointments with overlapping time ranges, and during the creation of an appointment, the Doctor entity does not change its state. The idea is that we can force Hibernate to update the Doctor's version, thus preventing concurrent insertions of appointments. Let’s update our DoctorRepository.findByIdAndLock() method to make it use optimistic locking. For that we’ll add the @Lock(LockModeType.OPTIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT) annotation. @Repository public interface DoctorRepository extends JpaRepository\u003cDoctor, String\u003e { @Lock(LockModeType.OPTIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT) @Query(\"select d from Doctor d where d.id = :id\") Doctor findByIdAndLock(@Param(\"id\") String id); } Our AppointmentService didn’t suffer any changes, it still calls the DoctorRepository.findByIdAndLock() method, but this time using optimistic-locking (see below): @Service @Slf4j public class AppointmentService { private final AppointmentRepository appointmentRepository; private final DoctorRepository doctorRepository; public AppointmentService(AppointmentRepository appointmentRepository, DoctorRepository doctorRepository) { this.appointmentRepository = appointmentRepository; this.doctorRepository = doctorRepository; } @Transactional public Appointment create(Appointment appointmentToCreate) { checkForConflicts(appointmentToCreate); return appointmentRepository.save(appointmentToCreate); } private void checkForConflicts(Appointment appointmentToCreate) { LocalDate appointmentDate = appointmentToCreate.getAppointmentDate(); LocalTime startTime = appointmentToCreate.getStartTime(); LocalTime endTime = appointmentToCreate.getEndTime(); String doctorId = appointmentToCreate.getDoctor().getId(); Doctor doctor = doctorRepository.findByIdAndLock(doctorId); //here we use a LockModeType.OPTIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT //which means that at flush-time, Hibernate will try //to detect if a concurrent modification happened and rollback the //transaction if so Optional\u003cAppointment\u003e conflictingAppointment = appointmentRepository.findConflictingAppointment(doctorId, appointmentDate, startTime, endTime); conflictingAppointment.ifPresent(overlappingAppointment -\u003e { throw new ConflictingAppointmentsException(\"Doctor \" + doctor.getFirstName() + \" \" + doctor.getLastName() + \" has already an appo","date":"2022-05-19","objectID":"/posts/optimistic_and_pessimistic_locking_with_spring_data_jpa/:5:1","tags":["Spring Framework","Concurrency control","Pessimistic locking","Optimistic locking"],"title":"Optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control with Spring-Data-JPA","uri":"/posts/optimistic_and_pessimistic_locking_with_spring_data_jpa/"},{"categories":["Concurrency control","Spring Framework"],"content":"Pessimistic vs Optimistic locking At the first glance, we’ve achieved the same thing with both pessimistic and optimistic locking. What are the subtle differences? Let’s write a test to find out. We are going to try to create 3 appointments at the same time, for the same doctor, something like this: Appointment A with start time 2022-05-23T16:00 and end time 2022-05-23T17:00 Appointment B with start time 2022-05-23T16:00 and end time 2022-05-23T17:00 (the same as above) Appointment C with start time 2022-05-23T11:00 and end time 2022-05-23T14:00 Appointment A and B have overlapping times, so only one of them should succeed (depending on which one will be first). Appointment C does not create any overlaps, so it should succeed in our case. Thus, we expect that only 2 appointments should be created. Either A and C or B and C. Now let’s write our test, which will be a bit complicated. We’ll be using pessimistic locking first. Let’s update the DoctorRepository to use pessimistic locking: @Repository public interface DoctorRepository extends JpaRepository\u003cDoctor, String\u003e { @Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE) @Query(\"select d from Doctor d where d.id = :id\") Doctor findByIdAndLock(@Param(\"id\") String id); } The test will look like this: @Slf4j @SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT) public class PessimisticVsOptimisticAppointmentControllerTest extends AbstractWebIntegrationTest { private static final int NUMBER_OF_CONCURRENT_USERS = 3; private final CountDownLatch startLatch = new CountDownLatch(1); private final CountDownLatch requestLatch = new CountDownLatch(NUMBER_OF_CONCURRENT_USERS); private final ExecutorService requestPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NUMBER_OF_CONCURRENT_USERS); @Test public void shouldBeAbleToCreateTwoAppointments() { IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 2).forEach((item) -\u003e { //Execute simultaneously 2 overlapping appointments: A and B requestPool.submit(() -\u003e { await(startLatch); log.info(\"Executing create appointment HTTP request\"); String payload = \"\"\" { \"doctorId\": \"620e11c0-7d59-45be-85cc-0dc146532e78\", \"patientId\": \"f44e4567-ef9c-12d3-a45b-52661417400a\", \"startDate\": \"2022-05-23T16:00\", \"endDate\": \"2022-05-23T17:00\", \"operation\": \"Annual physical\", \"details\": \"New patient\" } \"\"\"; RequestEntity\u003cString\u003e request = makeRequestFor(\"/api/v1/appointments/\", HttpMethod.POST, payload); ResponseEntity\u003cString\u003e response = restTemplate.exchange(request, String.class); log.info(\"Received HTTP status code: {}\", response.getStatusCode().value()); requestLatch.countDown(); }); }); requestPool.submit(() -\u003e { //Execute appointment C, which doesn't have any overlaps await(startLatch); log.info(\"Executing create appointment HTTP request\"); String payload = \"\"\" { \"doctorId\": \"620e11c0-7d59-45be-85cc-0dc146532e78\", \"patientId\": \"f44e4567-ef9c-12d3-a45b-52661417400a\", \"startDate\": \"2022-05-23T11:00\", \"endDate\": \"2022-05-23T14:00\", \"operation\": \"Annual physical\", \"details\": \"New patient\" } \"\"\"; RequestEntity\u003cString\u003e request = makeRequestFor(\"/api/v1/appointments/\", HttpMethod.POST, payload); ResponseEntity\u003cString\u003e response = restTemplate.exchange(request, String.class); log.info(\"Received HTTP status code: {}\", response.getStatusCode().value()); requestLatch.countDown(); }); startLatch.countDown(); await(requestLatch); RequestEntity\u003cAppointmentResponse[]\u003e allAppointmentsRequest = makeRequestFor(\"/api/v1/appointments/\", HttpMethod.GET); ResponseEntity\u003cAppointmentResponse[]\u003e allAppointmentsResponse = restTemplate.exchange(allAppointmentsRequest, AppointmentResponse[].class); assertThat(allAppointmentsResponse.getStatusCode().value()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.OK.value()); log.info(\"All appointments: {}\", Arrays.toString(allAppointmentsResponse.getBody())); assertThat(allAppointmentsResponse.getBody()).contains(makeExpectedAppointments()); //We expect 2 appointments to be created } private AppointmentResponse[] makeExpectedAppointments() { return new AppointmentResponse[]{ AppointmentResponse.builder() .","date":"2022-05-19","objectID":"/posts/optimistic_and_pessimistic_locking_with_spring_data_jpa/:6:0","tags":["Spring Framework","Concurrency control","Pessimistic locking","Optimistic locking"],"title":"Optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control with Spring-Data-JPA","uri":"/posts/optimistic_and_pessimistic_locking_with_spring_data_jpa/"},{"categories":["Concurrency control","Spring Framework"],"content":"Implementing retries on the server-side with Spring Retry In order to implement retries on the server side, we can use Spring Retry.

Now we can use the @Retryable annotation to specify what method should be re-executed in case of optimistic lock failures. Spring-Data-Jpa will throw the ObjectOptimisticLockingFailureException whenever we have concurrent modifications of a versioned JPA entity. A good candidate for retries it the AppointmentFacade.create() method (which is shown below), since it is the one starting the transaction: @Component public class AppointmentFacade { //... @Retryable(ObjectOptimisticLockingFailureException.class) //Retry 3 times in case of ObjectOptimisticLockingFailureException public AppointmentResponse create(UpsertAppointmentRequest request) { Appointment appointmentToCreate = toAppointment(request); Appointment createdAppointment = appointmentService.create(appointmentToCreate); return AppointmentResponse.from(createdAppointment); } //... } Let’s re-run our test to see if using retries helped: Looking good, the test passed. The gist is that whenever we have optimistic locking in place, sometimes we should also implement server-side retries.

We can obtain mutual-exclusion for the save method by adding the synchronized keyword. Will it solve the issue? Well, almost. Let’s try it out: @Service @Slf4j public class AppointmentService { private final AppointmentRepository appointmentRepository; private final DoctorRepository doctorRepository; public AppointmentService(AppointmentRepository appointmentRepository, DoctorRepository doctorRepository) { this.appointmentRepository = appointmentRepository; this.doctorRepository = doctorRepository; } @Transactional public synchronized Appointment create(Appointment appointmentToCreate) { //synchronized keyword was added checkForConflicts(appointmentToCreate); return appointmentRepository.save(appointmentToCreate); } } The test still fails. Very strange isn’t it. Here’s the explanation: Explanation Since the AppointmentService class has @Transactional methods, Spring will create a proxy for the AppointmentService. The original AppointmentService.create() method is synchronized, but the same method from the proxy isn’t. Also, the proxy is the one performing the EntityManager flush before the commit. That effectively means that at the time we’ve exited the synchronized method, the SQL inserts were not executed yet. That leaves time for another thread to grab the lock and start executing the create() method. This means that the second thread might not see the previously inserted appointment so it will come to the conclusion that no overlapp is present and insert successfully the conflicting appointment. What we need to do is to ensure that lock is released only after the proxy flushed the persistence context and committed the transaction. We can achieve this by placing a synchronized block in the facade, like this: @Component public class AppointmentFacade { private final AppointmentService appointmentService; private final DoctorService doctorService; private final PatientService patientService; public AppointmentFacade(AppointmentService appointmentService, DoctorService doctorService, PatientService patientService) { this.appointmentService = appointmentService; this.doctorService = doctorService; this.patientService = patientService; } public AppointmentResponse create(UpsertAppointmentRequest request) { Appointment appointmentToCreate = toAppointment(request); Appointment createdAppointment = null; synchronized (this) { //We need to add the synchronized block here createdAppointment = appointmentService.create(appointmentToCreate); } return AppointmentResponse.from(createdAppointment); } private Appointment toAppointment(final UpsertAppointmentRequest request) { //... } } Let’s try it out: It appears to be working at the first glance, but it’s the worst solution (it can hardly can be called a solution). This solution will limit our ability to scale the application not only because the throughput will be reduced significantly but also we are unable to run another instance of our application. If we run the second instance of our application, we’ll have another JVM with a brand-new heap so we lose mutual exclusion. With the synchronized keyword we obtain mutual-exclusion per JVM so a second JVM will bring back our problem with the race condition.

Now we can annotate the method for which we want to obtain mutual-exclusion across multiple application instances with the @SchedulerLock annotation, (see below): @Service @Slf4j public class AppointmentService { private static final String CREATE_APPOINTMENT_LOCK_NAME = \"createAppointmentLock\"; private final AppointmentRepository appointmentRepository; public AppointmentService(AppointmentRepository appointmentRepository) { this.appointmentRepository = appointmentRepository; } @Transactional @SchedulerLock(name = CREATE_APPOINTMENT_LOCK_NAME) public Appointment create(Appointment appointmentToCreate) { checkForConflicts(appointmentToCreate); return appointmentRepository.save(appointmentToCreate); } private void checkForConflicts(Appointment appointmentToCreate) { LocalDate appointmentDate = appointmentToCreate.getAppointmentDate(); LocalTime startTime = appointmentToCreate.getStartTime(); LocalTime endTime = appointmentToCreate.getEndTime(); String doctorId = appointmentToCreate.getDoctor().getId(); Doctor doctor = appointmentToCreate.getDoctor(); Optional\u003cAppointment\u003e conflictingAppointment = appointmentRepository.findConflictingAppointment(doctorId, appointmentDate, startTime, endTime); conflictingAppointment.ifPresent(overlappingAppointment -\u003e { throw new ConflictingAppointmentsException(\"Doctor \" + doctor.getFirstName() + \" \" + doctor.getLastName() + \" has already an appointment, starting from \" + overlappingAppointment.getStartTime() + \" till \" + overlappingAppointment.getEndTime()); }); } } That’s it.

We saw that when using optimistic locking, sometimes server-side retries are needed. We’ve also looked at the synchronized keyword and saw that it’s applicable only for the cases where we have only one instance of our application and don’t plan to add new ones.

We have a CommandLineRunner which calls the MovieService.save() method which saves to the database a Movie JPA entity using Spring-Data-JPA. The Movie entity looks like this btw: @Entity @Table(name = \"movies\") public class Movie extends AbstractEntity { private String name; //Getters, setters, toString and the builder are omitted for brevity Now let’s say we want to implement some form of auditing. Every time a Movie entity is saved, we want to save also a MovieAudit entity, just for inspection purposes. The MovieAudit entity looks like this: @Entity @Table(name = \"movie_audit\") public class MovieAudit extends AbstractEntity { private String name; private String movieId; public static MovieAudit from(Movie movie) { return MovieAudit.builder() .movieId(movie.getId()) .name(movie.getName()) .build(); } //Getters, setters, toString and the builder are omitted for brevity Now in order to implement the required behavior, we can inject the repository for the MovieAudit entity directly into our MovieService and save our MovieAudit along with the Movie entity in the same transaction, like this: @Service @Slf4j class MovieService { private final MovieRepository movieRepository; private final MovieAuditRepository movieAuditRepository; public MovieService(MovieRepository movieRepository, MovieAuditRepository movieAuditRepository) { this.movieRepository = movieRepository; this.movieAuditRepository = movieAuditRepository; } @Transactional public Movie save(Movie movie) { Movie savedMovie = movieRepository.save(movie); log.debug(\"Saved movie: {}\", savedMovie); movieAuditRepository.save(MovieAudit.from(savedMovie)); return savedMovie; } } This approach doesn’t look that good since our MovieService looks a bit messier.

For example if in the future we’ll be required to do some other action every time a Movie entity is saved, we can just add a new event-listener. Our event-listener which persists the MovieAudit can look like this: @Slf4j @Component class MovieAuditEventListener { private final MovieAuditRepository movieAuditRepository; public MovieAuditEventListener(MovieAuditRepository movieAuditRepository) { this.movieAuditRepository = movieAuditRepository; } @EventListener(MovieSavedEvent.class) @Transactional public void on(MovieSavedEvent event) { log.debug(\"Received event: {}\", event); MovieAudit movieAudit = MovieAudit.from(event.getMovie()); movieAuditRepository.save(movieAudit); log.debug(\"Saved movie audit: {}\", movieAudit); } } Let’s run the example and check the logs: 2022-05-16 23:51:14.100 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Creating new transaction with name [inc.evil.spring.tx.management.MovieService.save]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,ISOLATION_DEFAULT 2022-05-16 23:51:14.100 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Opened new EntityManager [SessionImpl(1483155688\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction 2022-05-16 23:51:14.102 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Exposing JPA transaction as JDBC [org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaDialect$HibernateConnectionHandle@f4f843f] 2022-05-16 23:51:14.106 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Found thread-bound EntityManager [SessionImpl(1483155688\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction 2022-05-16 23:51:14.106 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Participating in existing transaction 2022-05-16 23:51:14.114 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] i.e.spring.tx.management.MovieService: Saved movie: Movie{name='Joker', id='e4d96c77-fbe4-4407-af35-e11176a79da5'} 2022-05-16 23:51:14.115 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Found thread-bound EntityManager [SessionImpl(1483155688\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction 2022-05-16 23:51:14.115 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Participating in existing transaction 2022-05-16 23:51:14.117 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] i.e.s.t.m.MovieAuditEventListener : Received event: MovieSavedEvent{movie=Movie{name='Joker', id='e4d96c77-fbe4-4407-af35-e11176a79da5'}} 2022-05-16 23:51:14.117 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Found thread-bound EntityManager [SessionImpl(1483155688\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction 2022-05-16 23:51:14.117 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Participating in existing transaction 2022-05-16 23:51:14.118 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] i.e.s.t.m.MovieAuditEventListener : Saved movie audit: MovieAudit{name='Joker', id='b73e3f40-7cad-4821-91ca-c867bd1e79da', movieId='e4d96c77-fbe4-4407-af35-e11176a79da5'} 2022-05-16 23:51:14.119 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Initiating transaction commit 2022-05-16 23:51:14.119 DEBUG 1641040 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Committing JPA transaction on EntityManager [SessionImpl(1483155688\u003copen\u003e)] Hibernate: insert into movies (name, id) values (?, ?)

Our listener will look something like this: @Slf4j @Component class MovieAuditEventListener { private final MovieAuditRepository movieAuditRepository; public MovieAuditEventListener(MovieAuditRepository movieAuditRepository) { this.movieAuditRepository = movieAuditRepository; } @TransactionalEventListener(phase = TransactionPhase.AFTER_COMMIT) @Transactional public void on(MovieSavedEvent event) { log.debug(\"Received event: {}\", event); MovieAudit movieAudit = MovieAudit.from(event.getMovie()); movieAuditRepository.save(movieAudit); log.debug(\"Saved movie audit: {}\", movieAudit); } } Now let’s check the logs: 2022-05-16 23:53:07.427 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Creating new transaction with name [inc.evil.spring.tx.management.MovieService.save]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,ISOLATION_DEFAULT 2022-05-16 23:53:07.427 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Opened new EntityManager [SessionImpl(1305564302\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction 2022-05-16 23:53:07.428 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Exposing JPA transaction as JDBC [org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaDialect$HibernateConnectionHandle@3b362f1] 2022-05-16 23:53:07.432 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Found thread-bound EntityManager [SessionImpl(1305564302\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction 2022-05-16 23:53:07.432 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Participating in existing transaction 2022-05-16 23:53:07.442 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] i.e.spring.tx.management.MovieService: Saved movie: Movie{name='Joker', id='dc766b33-2ba7-4989-bea2-99734243f0c9'} 2022-05-16 23:53:07.443 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Initiating transaction commit 2022-05-16 23:53:07.443 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Committing JPA transaction on EntityManager [SessionImpl(1305564302\u003copen\u003e)] Hibernate: insert into movies (name, id) values (?, ?) 2022-05-16 23:53:07.454 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Found thread-bound EntityManager [SessionImpl(1305564302\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction 2022-05-16 23:53:07.454 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Participating in existing transaction 2022-05-16 23:53:07.456 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] i.e.s.t.m.MovieAuditEventListener : Received event: MovieSavedEvent{movie=Movie{name='Joker', id='dc766b33-2ba7-4989-bea2-99734243f0c9'}} 2022-05-16 23:53:07.457 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Found thread-bound EntityManager [SessionImpl(1305564302\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction 2022-05-16 23:53:07.457 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Participating in existing transaction 2022-05-16 23:53:07.458 DEBUG 1641223 --- [main] i","date":"2022-05-16","objectID":"/posts/spring_puzzler_transactional_event_listener/:4:0","tags":["Spring Framework","Declarative transaction management","@TransactionalEventListener"],"title":"Spring puzzler: the @TransactionalEventListener","uri":"/posts/spring_puzzler_transactional_event_listener/"},{"categories":["Spring Framework"],"content":"Explanation The short version is that the MovieService has created a transaction and has bound it to the current thread. Then the MovieService's proxy commits the transaction and invokes the @TransactionalEventListener. The thing is that at this point, the initial transaction is already committed but it wasn’t yet cleaned-up (or unbound from the current thread). Because of that, when the MovieAuditEventListener is called, it thinks that there’s an existing transaction and it tries to join it. The listener thinks that there’s an existing transaction because it can find the thread-local data of the previously committed transaction. This way Spring is fooled and it joins a committed transaction. Now, the SQL insert for the MovieAudit was lost since Hibernate usually executes inserts at flush-time (which happens at the transaction commit), but since the transaction was committed a long time ago, nothing happens. We can’t commit a transaction twice. In-depth explanation The TransactionSynchronizationManager class is the place where all of the thread-bounded transaction data is stored, like this: package org.springframework.transaction.support; public abstract class TransactionSynchronizationManager { private static final ThreadLocal\u003cMap\u003cObject, Object\u003e\u003e resources = new NamedThreadLocal\u003c\u003e(\"Transactional resources\"); private static final ThreadLocal\u003cSet\u003cTransactionSynchronization\u003e\u003e synchronizations = new NamedThreadLocal\u003c\u003e(\"Transaction synchronizations\"); private static final ThreadLocal\u003cString\u003e currentTransactionName = new NamedThreadLocal\u003c\u003e(\"Current transaction name\"); private static final ThreadLocal\u003cBoolean\u003e currentTransactionReadOnly = new NamedThreadLocal\u003c\u003e(\"Current transaction read-only status\"); private static final ThreadLocal\u003cInteger\u003e currentTransactionIsolationLevel = new NamedThreadLocal\u003c\u003e(\"Current transaction isolation level\"); private static final ThreadLocal\u003cBoolean\u003e actualTransactionActive = new NamedThreadLocal\u003c\u003e(\"Actual transaction active\"); //... When the PlatformTransactionManager (in our case it’s the JpaTransactionManager) needs to see if there’s an active transaction, it checks the TransactionSynchronizationManager to see if we have any thread-bounded resources, like this: package org.springframework.orm.jpa; public class JpaTransactionManager extends AbstractPlatformTransactionManager implements ResourceTransactionManager, BeanFactoryAware, InitializingBean { //... @Override protected Object doGetTransaction() { JpaTransactionObject txObject = new JpaTransactionObject(); txObject.setSavepointAllowed(isNestedTransactionAllowed()); EntityManagerHolder emHolder = (EntityManagerHolder) TransactionSynchronizationManager.getResource(obtainEntityManagerFactory()); //Do we have already an EntityManger? if (emHolder != null) { if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) { logger.debug(\"Found thread-bound EntityManager [\" + emHolder.getEntityManager() + \"] for JPA transaction\"); } txObject.setEntityManagerHolder(emHolder, false); //If found an existing EntityManager, set it on the new transaction object } if (getDataSource() != null) { ConnectionHolder conHolder = (ConnectionHolder) TransactionSynchronizationManager.getResource(getDataSource()); //Find the JDBC Connection holder txObject.setConnectionHolder(conHolder); //Set it on the new transaction object } return txObject; } At this point, nothing fancy happened. We’ve just collected the data about the existing transaction (if any). Spring has instantiated a JpaTransactionObject instance and has populated it with the thread-bound EntityManagerHolder (which has an EntityManager) and a ConnectionHolder (which has a JDBC Connection). But these 2 values can have the value of null if there isn’t an existing transaction. Now Spring checks if we do have an active transaction, like this: package org.springframework.transaction.support; public abstract class AbstractPlatformTransactionManager implements PlatformTransactionManager, Serializable { //... @Override public final TransactionStatu","date":"2022-05-16","objectID":"/posts/spring_puzzler_transactional_event_listener/:5:0","tags":["Spring Framework","Declarative transaction management","@TransactionalEventListener"],"title":"Spring puzzler: the @TransactionalEventListener","uri":"/posts/spring_puzzler_transactional_event_listener/"},{"categories":["Spring Framework"],"content":"How to fix it?

Let’s look at an example: @Slf4j @SpringBootApplication public class SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication.class, args); } } @Service @Slf4j class MovieService { @Autowired private EntityManager entityManager; public MovieService() { log.debug(\"entityManager: {}\", entityManager); } @PostConstruct public void init() { log.debug(\"entityManager: {}\", entityManager); } } We have a MovieService which is a Spring bean, and it used field-injection to get a dependency - the EntityManager. The question is, when is our spring bean fully-initialized and ready to be used? Usually we consider that after calling the constructor, the instantiated object is in the right state so it can be safely used. Let’s look at the logs to see if that’s the case: 2022-05-15 16:49:36.432 DEBUG 1451865 --- [main] i.e.spring.tx.management.MovieService: entityManager: null 2022-05-15 16:49:36.447 DEBUG 1451865 --- [main] i.e.spring.tx.management.MovieService: entityManager: Shared EntityManager proxy for target factory [org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean@79ab97fd] As we can see from the logs, when the MovieService constructor is executing, the entityManager field still has the value of null. The @PostConstruct methods come to the rescue. They’re invoked after all of the bean’s dependencies were set, no matter the injection type used: constructor, field or setter. Our logs prove that that’s the case, the field entityManager is no longer null when the @PostConstruct method was called. Tip It’s considered a best practice to use constructor injection and steer clear of field injection since field-injection makes unit-testing way harder than it needs to be and it also prevents us from having immutable beans.

The BeanCreationException exception is thrown when a @PostConstruct method throws an exception. Here are the logs: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'movieService': Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is javax.persistence.TransactionRequiredException: No EntityManager with actual transaction available for current thread - cannot reliably process 'persist' call at org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.InitDestroyAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.postProcessBeforeInitialization(InitDestroyAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.java:160) ~[spring-beans-5.3.19.jar:5.3.19] It’s worth stating that we deliberately used directly the EntityManager, since it doesn’t create any transactions but its persist method expects to be called with an active transaction.

To make it work, we need to add in the application.properties file the following property (otherwise an UnsatisfiedDependencyException will be thrown): spring.main.allow-circular-references=true When we do a “self-injection” with the @Autowired annotation, what we actually get is our proxy! In this case, we can try to call a @Transactional method though the proxy and in this way we’ll get a transaction. For that we’ve added a new public method annotated with the @Transactional annotation. Let’s check the logs to see if it actually works: 2022-05-16 07:31:05.159 DEBUG 1526158 --- [main] i.e.spring.tx.management.MovieService: entityManager: null 2022-05-16 07:31:05.183 DEBUG 1526158 --- [main] i.e.spring.tx.management.MovieService: entityManager: Shared EntityManager proxy for target factory [org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean@27c53c32] 2022-05-16 07:31:05.195 DEBUG 1526158 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Creating new transaction with name [inc.evil.spring.tx.management.MovieService.doInit]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,ISOLATION_DEFAULT 2022-05-16 07:31:05.208 DEBUG 1526158 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Opened new EntityManager [SessionImpl(266906347\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction 2022-05-16 07:31:05.210 DEBUG 1526158 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Exposing JPA transaction as JDBC [org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaDialect$HibernateConnectionHandle@42107318] 2022-05-16 07:31:05.228 DEBUG 1526158 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Initiating transaction commit 2022-05-16 07:31:05.228 DEBUG 1526158 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Committing JPA transaction on EntityManager [SessionImpl(266906347\u003copen\u003e)] Hibernate: insert into movies (name, id) values (?, ?) 2022-05-16 07:31:05.240 DEBUG 1526158 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Closing JPA EntityManager [SessionImpl(266906347\u003copen\u003e)] after transaction Indeed, our JPA entity was successfully inserted into the database.

The most common reason for using transactions in an application is to maintain a high degree of data integrity and consistency. If we’re unconcerned about the quality of our data, we don’t need to concern ourselves with transactions. Transaction management is ubiquitous, it is present in every Java application which uses a database. The Spring Framework out of the box provides a lot of mechanisms to manage transactions and though it makes our lives easier, it is quite important to understand how it works and what happens under the hood since there are some pitfalls which can lead to undesired results. Let’s take a closer look at what transaction management mechanism Spring provides and how we can use them. Transactions ensure data integrity trough ACID guarantees, which can be recapped as: Atomicity Each transaction is “all or nothing”. All SQL statements in a transaction (select, insert, update, merge or delete) is treated as a single unit. Either all statements are executed, or none of it is executed. Consistency After a transaction, the database is guaranteed to be in a consistent state (all the integrity constraints will be satisfied) Isolation Concurrent transactions don’t interfere with or affect one another. Well, almost. It is possible to have some interference, depending on the used transaction isolation level. Durability Ensures that changes to your data made by successfully executed transactions will be saved, even in the event of system failure Let’s take a look at a practical example. Let’s try to insert into the database the following JPA entity 3 times: @MappedSuperclass public class AbstractEntity { @Id @GenericGenerator(name = \"uuid-generator\", strategy = \"org.hibernate.id.UUIDGenerator\") @GeneratedValue(generator = \"uuid-generator\") protected String id; protected AbstractEntity() { } public String getId() { return id; } public boolean equals(Object other) { if (!(other instanceof AbstractEntity otherEntity)) return false; return Objects.equals(id, otherEntity.getId()); } public int hashCode() { return getClass().hashCode(); } } @Entity @Table(name = \"movies\") public class Movie extends AbstractEntity { private String name; protected Movie() { } private Movie(MovieBuilder builder) { this.name = builder.name; } public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; } @Override public String toString() { return \"Movie{\" + \"name='\" + name + '\\'' + \", id='\" + id + '\\'' + '}'; } public static MovieBuilder builder() { return new MovieBuilder(); } public static class MovieBuilder { private String name; public MovieBuilder name(String name) { this.name = name; return this; } public Movie build() { return new Movie(this); } } } In order to do that, we can create the following Spring Data JPA repository: @Repository public interface MovieRepository extends JpaRepository\u003cMovie, String\u003e { } We can use the MovieRepository presented above and try to insert 3 movies into the database, like shown below: @Slf4j @SpringBootApplication public class SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication.class, args); } @Bean public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(MovieService movieService) { return args -\u003e { List\u003cString\u003e movieNames = List.of( \"Pulp fiction\", \"Joker\", \"Snatch\" ); List\u003cMovie\u003e savedMovies = movieService.saveMovies(movieNames); log.debug(\"Saved movies: {}\", savedMovies); }; } } @Service class MovieService { private final MovieRepository movieRepository; public MovieService(MovieRepository movieRepository) { this.movieRepository = movieRepository; } public List\u003cMovie\u003e saveMovies(List\u003cString\u003e movieNames) { return movieNames.stream() .map(movieName -\u003e Movie.builder() .name(movieName) .build() ) .map(movieRepository::save) .toList(); } } The question is, how many database transactions are executed by the MovieService.saveMovies() method?

To make the MovieService.saveMovies() method atomic and obtain the “all or nothing” behavior, we can just annotate the method with @Transactional annotation.

This is not the preferred approach nowadays, but it does have its use-cases. Before showing any code examples, it’s worth mentioning that when it comes to transaction management (doesn’t matter declarative or programmatic), the entry-point is a spring bean of type PlatformTransactionManager with the name transactionManager. There are different implementations of the PlatformTransactionManager interface, depending on the environment we’re using. Some noteworthy implementations are: org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager: if we intend to use Hibernate (with or without Spring Data Jpa) org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager: if we intend to use sping-jdbc (with the JdbcTemplate) or Springh Data Jdbc org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager: if we intend to use distributed (or XA) transactions (meaning transactions spanning more than one transactional resource, like a database and a message queue). Although XA transactions look nice, it’s considered a relic of the past and it’s best to be avoided since it has some problems and is not supported by many modern technologies (like Apache Kafka for example). Using the programmatic transaction management involves using directly the PlatformTransactionManager. As we can see below, it’s rather cumbersome to use. The first thing we need to do is to instantiate a DefaultTransactionDefinition which we can use to specify the desired propagation behavior, transaction name, the isolation level, the transaction timeout and the transaction read-only flag. After that by calling the PlatformTransactionManager.getTransaction(TransactionDefinition) method we effectively start the transaction with the desired attributes, execute the unit of work, and then we can try to commit it. If at some point the transaction was marked as rollback-only, it cannot be committed and the only possible outcome is a transaction rollback. @Service class ProgrammaticTxMovieService { private final EntityManager entityManager; private final PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager; public ProgrammaticTxMovieService(EntityManager entityManager, PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager) { this.entityManager = entityManager; this.transactionManager = transactionManager; } public Movie saveMovie(String movieName) { DefaultTransactionDefinition definition = new DefaultTransactionDefinition(); definition.setPropagationBehavior(TransactionDefinition.PROPAGATION_REQUIRED); definition.setName(\"saveMovie\"); TransactionStatus transaction = transactionManager.getTransaction(definition); try { Movie movie = Movie.builder() .name(movieName) .build(); entityManager.persist(movie); return movie; } catch (Exception e) { transaction.setRollbackOnly(); throw e; } finally { transactionManager.commit(transaction); } } } It’s worth mentioning that injecting the EntityManager directly into a service is kind of an unorthodox approach since services shouldn’t directly talk to the database but should delegate to a DAO instead. The rule was broken for the sake of brevity. A slightly simpler approach is to use the TransactionTemplate class which basically abstracts away the commit and rollback logic. Instead or writing this logic ourselves, we pass a callback. If the callback will not throw any exceptions, the transaction will be committed, otherwise a rollback will happen. @Service class TransactionTemplateProgrammaticTxMovieService { private final EntityManager entityManager; private final PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager; public TransactionTemplateProgrammaticTxMovieService(EntityManager entityManager, PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager) { this.entityManager = entityManager; this.transactionManager = transactionManager; } public Movie saveMovie(String movieName) { DefaultTransactionDefinition def","date":"2022-05-10","objectID":"/posts/introduction_to_declarative_tx_management/:3:1","tags":["Spring Framework","Declarative transaction management","Programmatic transaction management"],"title":"Introduction to declarative transaction management in Spring Framework","uri":"/posts/introduction_to_declarative_tx_management/"},{"categories":["Spring Framework"],"content":"Declarative transaction management With declarative transaction management, we just specify for what methods we want transactional behavior by annotating them with the @Transactional annotation and Spring will take care of the rest. It works something like this: @Slf4j @SpringBootApplication public class SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication.class, args); } @Bean public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(MovieService movieService) { return args -\u003e { List\u003cString\u003e movieNames = List.of( \"Pulp fiction\", \"Joker\", \"Snatch\" ); List\u003cMovie\u003e savedMovies = movieService.saveMovies(movieNames); log.debug(\"Saved movies: {}\", savedMovies); }; } } @Service class MovieService { private final MovieRepository movieRepository; public MovieService(MovieRepository movieRepository) { this.movieRepository = movieRepository; } @Transactional public List\u003cMovie\u003e saveMovies(List\u003cString\u003e movieNames) { return movieNames.stream() .map(movieName -\u003e Movie.builder() .name(movieName) .build() ) .map(movieRepository::save) .toList(); } } But how exactly does it work? We just annotated a method with an annotation and somehow that method now executes within a transaction. But who starts the transaction? Who commits or rolls-back it? The answer is simple, it’s a proxy! Just as a refresher, the proxy pattern looks like this: We have the Subject interface with the implementation Real Subject. We also have a Proxy which implements the Subject interface, so the proxy looks like a real Subject but it adds additional behavior like caching, logging, security or even transactions. The proxy also has a reference to the real implementation. The client, though unaware of this, will use the Proxy thinking it’s “the real thing”. Let’s try to log the actual class name of the MovieService, and see what’s really going on. @Bean public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(MovieService movieService) { return args -\u003e { log.debug(\"MovieService actual class name: {}\", movieService.getClass().getName()); }; } then, in the logs we will see something like this: 2022-05-11 09:01:10.367 DEBUG 498664 --- [main] SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication: MovieService actual class name: inc.evil.spring.tx.management.MovieService$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$38b14d5 We can observe that the actual class name is inc.evil.spring.tx.management.MovieService$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$38b14d5, but in our codebase we have a simple MovieService. Because our MovieService has methods annotated with @Transactional annotation, Spring has created a CGLib proxy for our service and all the logic regarding transaction creation, commit or roll-back is executed precisely by that proxy. So, whenever we have a service which has methods annotated with the @Transactional annotation, Spring will create a proxy for that service and put it in the ApplicationContext. Wherever we want to inject that service, a proxy will be injected instead. The proxy will intercept all the public method calls, check if the method needs a transaction and if so, it will create it and then it will delegate to the original MovieService. After the original method from the MovieService was executed, the proxy will then commit or rollback the transaction, depending on what (if any) exceptions were thrown. As a sequence diagram, the flow looks like this: We can summarize the flow like this: The CommandLineRunner calls MovieService.saveMovies() method. What the CommandLineRunner doesn’t know is that it actually has a reference to a proxy. So in reality the CommandLineRunner is invoking a proxy (a class generated by CGLib in runtime, which looks like a MovieService but it’s a completely different class called MovieService$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$38b14d5) The proxy (the MovieService$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$38b14d5 class) sees that the invoked method (the saveMovies method) is annotated with the @Transactional annotation, so we need a transaction mos","date":"2022-05-10","objectID":"/posts/introduction_to_declarative_tx_management/:3:2","tags":["Spring Framework","Declarative transaction management","Programmatic transaction management"],"title":"Introduction to declarative transaction management in Spring Framework","uri":"/posts/introduction_to_declarative_tx_management/"},{"categories":["Spring Framework"],"content":"@Transactional method visibility By default, only public methods can be annotated with the @Transactional annotation.

Because the transaction was marked as rollback-only, it cannot be committed, even though it tried to (see Initiating transaction commit in the logs). Also we can notice that trying to catch the exception didn’t help at all, since the exception “passed though” the proxy and because of that , it has set the rollback-only flag. We can also observe that all of the database work done by both services was lost (or rolled-back) since we don’t have any SQL statements logged (we’ve configured Hibernate to do so). 2022-05-11 17:02:05.767 DEBUG 716638 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Creating new transaction with name [inc.evil.spring.tx.management.MovieService.saveMovie]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,ISOLATION_DEFAULT 2022-05-11 17:02:05.767 DEBUG 716638 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Opened new EntityManager [SessionImpl(1478683866\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction 2022-05-11 17:02:05.769 DEBUG 716638 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Exposing JPA transaction as JDBC [org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaDialect$HibernateConnectionHandle@3ee6dc82] 2022-05-11 17:02:05.777 DEBUG 716638 --- [main] i.e.s.tx.management.MovieService: Calling ActorService 2022-05-11 17:02:05.778 DEBUG 716638 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Found thread-bound EntityManager [SessionImpl(1478683866\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction 2022-05-11 17:02:05.778 DEBUG 716638 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Participating in existing transaction 2022-05-11 17:02:05.781 DEBUG 716638 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Participating transaction failed - marking existing transaction as rollback-only 2022-05-11 17:02:05.781 DEBUG 716638 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Setting JPA transaction on EntityManager [SessionImpl(1","date":"2022-05-10","objectID":"/posts/introduction_to_declarative_tx_management/:4:1","tags":["Spring Framework","Declarative transaction management","Programmatic transaction management"],"title":"Introduction to declarative transaction management in Spring Framework","uri":"/posts/introduction_to_declarative_tx_management/"},{"categories":["Spring Framework"],"content":"@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW) When calling a method annotated with @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW), if the current thread is not associated with a transaction, a new transaction will be created.

If we were to remove the try-catch block from the MovieService.saveMovie() method, both transactions will be rolled-back.

This could lead to unexpected results sometimes. Let’s look at an example. The MovieService.saveMovie() method is the one starting the transaction and it declares the transaction timeout as one second. The ActorService.saveActor() method will join the existing transaction, but it wants a timeout of 10 seconds. Also the ActorService.saveActor() has an artificial delay of 2 seconds.

We can easily verify that when creating a new transaction an EntityManager is created as well by looking at the following example: @Slf4j @SpringBootApplication public class SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication.class, args); } @Bean public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(MovieService movieService) { return args -\u003e { movieService.saveMovie(\"Pulp fiction\"); }; } } @Service @Slf4j class MovieService { private final EntityManager entityManager; public MovieServiceOne(EntityManager entityManager) { this.entityManager = entityManager; } @Transactional protected Movie saveMovie(String movieName) { Movie movie = Movie.builder() .name(movieName) .build(); entityManager.persist(movie); return movie; } } In the logs we can observe the sequence: Opened new EntityManager [SessionImpl(1982072255\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction and Closing JPA EntityManager [SessionImpl(1982072255\u003copen\u003e)] after transaction. 2022-05-13 08:42:02.640 DEBUG 1250340 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager: Creating new transaction with name [inc.evil.spring.tx.management.MovieServiceOne.saveMovie]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,ISOLATION_DEFAULT 2022-05-13 08:42:02.641 DEBUG 1250340 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager: Opened new EntityManager [SessionImpl(1982072255\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction 2022-05-13 08:42:02.642 DEBUG 1250340 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager: Exposing JPA transaction as JDBC [org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaDialect$HibernateConnectionHandle@37a67cf] 2022-05-13 08:42:02.652 DEBUG 1250340 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager: Initiating transaction commit 2022-05-13 08:42:02.653 DEBUG 1250340 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager: Committing JPA transaction on EntityManager [SessionImpl(1982072255\u003copen\u003e)] Hibernate: insert into movies (name, id) values (?, ?) 2022-05-13 08:42:02.665 DEBUG 1250340 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager: Closing JPA EntityManager [SessionImpl(1982072255\u003copen\u003e)] after transaction It is known that the EntityManager acts as a first-level cache (in different sources there’s different nomenclature for this, sometimes this is called that the EntityManager has a persistence context or that the EntityManager represents the persistence context), which basically is a cache for entities in the persistent state. The question which arrives at this point is: when a transactional method from one service joins an existing transaction (created by another service), is the EntityManager reused? Let’s have a look at an example: @Slf4j @SpringBootApplication public class SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication.class, args); } @Bean public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(MovieServiceOne movieService) { return args -\u003e { movieService.findMovie(\"aa3e4567-e89b-12d3-b457-5267141750aa\"); }; } } @Service @Slf4j class MovieServiceOne { private final EntityManager entityManager; private final MovieServiceTwo movieServiceTwo; public MovieServiceOne(EntityManager entityManager, MovieServiceTwo movieServiceTwo) { this.entityManager = entityManager; this.movieServiceTwo = movieServiceTwo; } @Transactional protected Movie findMovie(String id) { Movie movie = entityManager.find(Movie.class, id); log.debug(\"Found movie: {}\", movie); movieServiceTwo.findMovie(id); return movie; } } @Service @Slf4j class MovieServiceTwo { private final EntityManager entityManager; public MovieServiceTwo(EntityManager entityManager) { t","date":"2022-05-10","objectID":"/posts/introduction_to_declarative_tx_management/:6:0","tags":["Spring Framework","Declarative transaction management","Programmatic transaction management"],"title":"Introduction to declarative transaction management in Spring Framework","uri":"/posts/introduction_to_declarative_tx_management/"},{"categories":["Spring Framework"],"content":"The readOnly attribute We can mark the transaction as being read-only by specifying the readOnly attribute, like this: @Transactional(readOnly = true). Read-only transactions are considered to be more performant and another effect of this attribute is that Hibernate's dirty-checking mechanisms would be disabled. When fetching an entity, Hibernate apart from the fact that it maps the ResultSet to a Java object, it creates a snapshot of the ResultSet so that it can use it later, at flush-time to determine if the entity is dirty (meaning we need to update the entity). With read-only transactions, this actions doesn’t take place and this is precisely the reason of performance improvement. Let’s check it. Take a look at the example below: @Slf4j @SpringBootApplication public class SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication.class, args); } @Bean public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(MovieService movieService) { return args -\u003e { movieService.findMovie(\"aa3e4567-e89b-12d3-b457-5267141750aa\"); }; } } @Service @Slf4j class MovieService { private final EntityManager entityManager; public MovieService(EntityManager entityManager) { this.entityManager = entityManager; } @Transactional(readOnly = true) protected Movie findMovie(String id) { Movie movie = entityManager.find(Movie.class, id); log.debug(\"Found movie: {}\", movie); movie.setName(movie.getName() + \"!\"); return movie; } } In the example above, in a read-only transaction we fetch a Movie entity and change its name (making the entity dirty). If we had a regular “write” transaction, this will trigger an SQL update on the movie table. Let’s check the logs to see what happened in our case: 2022-05-13 19:22:55.713 DEBUG 1353141 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager: Creating new transaction with name [inc.evil.spring.tx.management.MovieService.findMovie]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,ISOLATION_DEFAULT,readOnly 2022-05-13 19:22:55.713 DEBUG 1353141 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager: Opened new EntityManager [SessionImpl(196161345\u003copen\u003e)] for JPA transaction 2022-05-13 19:22:55.715 DEBUG 1353141 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager: Exposing JPA transaction as JDBC [org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaDialect$HibernateConnectionHandle@75dd0f94] Hibernate: select movie0_.id as id1_1_0_, movie0_.name as name2_1_0_ from movies movie0_ where movie0_.id=? 2022-05-13 19:22:55.724 DEBUG 1353141 --- [main] i.e.s.tx.management.MovieService : Found movie: Movie{name='Pulp Fiction!', id='aa3e4567-e89b-12d3-b457-5267141750aa'} 2022-05-13 19:22:55.725 DEBUG 1353141 --- [main] o.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager : Initiating transaction commit No SQL updates spotted, signifying that the dirty-checking mechanism was indeed disabled. Good idea If the transaction only reads data, mark it as read-only. This wil not only improve the performance, but also serve as a form of documentation. Now, what will happen if in a readOnly transaction we’ll try to persist an entity, as shown in the example below? @Slf4j @SpringBootApplication public class SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(SpringDeclarativeTxManagementApplication.class, args); } @Bean public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(MovieService movieService) { return args -\u003e { movieService.findMovie(\"aa3e4567-e89b-12d3-b457-5267141750aa\"); }; } } @Service @Slf4j class MovieService { private final EntityManager entityManager; public MovieService(EntityManager entityManager) { this.entityManager = entityManager; } @Transactional(readOnly = true) protected Movie findMovie(String id) { Movie movie = entityManager.find(Movie.class, id); log.debug(\"Found movie: {}\", movie); Movie newMovie = Movie.builder() .name(\"Joker\") .build(); entityManager.persist(newMovie); return movie; } } Well, the EntityManager.persist() will be silently ignored (without throwing any e","date":"2022-05-10","objectID":"/posts/introduction_to_declarative_tx_management/:6:1","tags":["Spring Framework","Declarative transaction management","Programmatic transaction management"],"title":"Introduction to declarative transaction management in Spring Framework","uri":"/posts/introduction_to_declarative_tx_management/"},{"categories":["Spring Framework"],"content":"Conclusion In this blog post we made a gentle introduction on Spring's declarative and programmatic transaction management approaches, looked at all the propagation levels, what’s the default commit and rollback behavior (and how to configure it), discussed that by default only public methods can be transactional, but with a bit of configuration we can enable the transactional behavior for package-private and protected methods as well. We also compared a bit the programmatic and declarative approaches and saw that they aren’t 100% equivalent, and we also saw that read-only transactions disable the dirty-checking mechanism. We’ll dive deeper in another blog post where we’ll look at some puzzlers and limitations of declarative transaction management.
