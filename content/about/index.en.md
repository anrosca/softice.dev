I have about 5 years of experience in development using the Java programming language. 

I'm very passionate and driven by a desire to learn as much as possible about the Java platform and its ecosystem, (`Spring Boot`, `Hibernate`, `AWS`, `Apache Kafka`, `Debezium` and many more) and to implement high-quality solutions using industry best practices.
