I am a software developer, working primarily with Java and the Spring framework.

I'm very passionate about the Java platform and its ecosystem, and my plan is to post here things I find interesting.

### Certifications

Though it's debatable if the certifications are worth doing or not, it does certainly help to double-check how well one knows a specific technology.

I passed following certifications:
